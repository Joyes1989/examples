    "Complex machine learning applications often require multi-stage pipelines (e.g., data loading, transforming, training, testing, iterating). **Workflows** in Spell allow you to manage these pipelines as a sequence of Spell runs, and are a lightweight alternative to tools like [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) and [Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi) for managing your model training pipelines.\n",

    "Workflows can be launched using either the Spell CLI or the Spell Python API. In this tutorial we demonstrate both approaches by example."

    "## understanding workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "Every workflow consists of one *master run* and one more more *worker runs*. The master run is responsible for control flow: that is, determining which worker runs should get executed when, and why. The worker runs then do all of the work required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our demo workflow consists of three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. downloading the dataset (a Project Gutenberg copy of _War and Peace_) and saving it to disk.\n",
    "2. mounting that text corpus into a run, training the neural network on it, and saving the model to disk.\n",
    "3. mounting the saved model into yet another run, sampling it for an interesting result, and streaming that output to logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, we will need one one master run and three worker runs, arranged thusly:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/W5Ugs0S.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this simple example we will execute the steps consecutively, conditioning the start of each worker run in the workflow on the success of its predecessor. More complex workflows may require more complicated control flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the instance type of the worker runs is configurable, the master run always executes on the basic `cpu` instance type. Try to keep any computationally intensive logic isolated to the workers!\n",
    "\n",
    "## understanding the workflow script\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to execute a workflow, we need to define a workflow script. The **workflow script** is what gets executed on the master run: a Python script using the Spell Python API to define worker jobs and the control flow logic surrounding them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the workflow script that we will be using for this demo. Don't worry if you don't understand all of it right away, we'll walk through it step by step."

    "\n",
    "We can only proceed to the next stage of the workflow when the first stage completes successfully. This next bit of code is a control flow block that achieves this end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every run transitions through a sequence of states as part of its execution: `machine_requested`, `running`, `pushing`, and so on. Runs eventually transition to a so-called **final state**: the state that the run is assigned at the end of its execution. There are four different possible final states, the most important of which is `COMPLETE`. A run which terminates in the `COMPLETE` state is one which has successfully run all of its code and pushed all of its outputs to SpellFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "This `wait_status` methods blocks execution until the run API reports that the run has reached a final state. We then `refresh` the information on the run object (this has to be done manually because it requires a network roundtrip) and check if the `r.status` field reports that the run is `COMPLETE`. We only proceed with the rest of the script if it is&mdash;if it is not, e.g. if the run reached a failing final state (`FAILED`, `STOPPED`, or `INTERRUPTED`), we raise an error instead.\n",

    "We are careful to mount the data to the correct `data_dir` inside of the new model training run using the `attached_resources` argument. Outputs that get saved to disk during a run are written to SpellFS at run exit time, allowing us to easily reuse the text corpus we downloaded in the previous command in the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we are not passing a `--github-url`! This script instead initializes its code environment using the `commit_label` field. If you skip ahead to the `spell workflow` command we used to initialize the workflow, you see that we set `--repo char-rnn=char-rnn-tensorflow/` as a parameter. When the master run sees that a run has been created with the `char-rnn` `commit_label` set, it knows to copy the contents of this directory into the run.\n",
