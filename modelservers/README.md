# Modelservers

Model servers allow you to deploy a trained model as a web API. Check out the docs at https://spell.ml/docs/model_servers. They include a quickstart which uses the code in the cifar directory here.

Model servers can easily be deployed on different types of machines, see https://spell.ml/docs/model_servers#node-groups. hello_nvidia is a simple hello world predictor which verifies you're using the GPU.
